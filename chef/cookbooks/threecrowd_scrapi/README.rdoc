= DESCRIPTION:

This cookbook installs and configures SCRAPI using environment settings and other metadata.
It discovers what cassandra servers to use by looking for nodes that have the threecrowd_cassandra
cookbook applied, so you will probably have to change that.

This cookbook defines nagios checks and thus depends on the nagios cookbook.

= REQUIREMENTS:

This cookbook assumes you are using runit to manage your services.
